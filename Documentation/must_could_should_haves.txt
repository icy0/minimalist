the texteditor must have:
----------------------------
- all the things that windows' default texteditor has
- ability to change background / font color
- decoders for the common file encodings on Microsoft Windows (UTF-8, Windows-1252 / "ANSI", ISO/IEC 8859-1, ASCII)


the texteditor should have:
----------------------------
- GPU acceleration
- support for any monospaced horizontal font
- support for Windows 7 and up
- as many files open as memory allows
- render as many files onscreen as hardware allows
- stop rendering when no input to decrease GPU load


the texteditor could have:
----------------------------
- support for Windows XP & Vista
- support for Linux (big undertaking obviously, as this texteditor is mainly aimed at Microsoft Windows operability)
- as sparse memory management as possible without losing performance
- as much GPU utilization as possible without losing performance
- support for more character encodings? (have to find out more about that stuff, as I don't know which of these are the most common)
